# NJ Makers Day 2016 - Intro to Home Automation with the ESP8266

#### Learn how to wire up a temperature and humidity sensor to to get accurate readings of your surroundings. Once everything is  up and running, send the data to a web server so you can monitor it anywhere.

<span style="float:right; margin-top:13px; width: 33%">![ESP8266 ESP-12e Development Board](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414oWD1NZzL.jpg "ESP8266 ESP-12e Development Board")</span>The aim of this project is to introduce new makers and tinkerers to the basics of circuitry, prototyping, and the Internet of Things. We will discuss the components used in the project, how to _"hook them up"_ properly and how to program the ESP8266 with a computer. If everything works as expected, we'll be able to interact with the web page(s) being built in the  _**Intro to Web Development**_ activity. Everything needed for this project will be provided. However the only takeaways will be the code you write, the knowledge you've gained during the activity and the friends you've made along the way.

The run time for this activity should be around one(1) hour.
