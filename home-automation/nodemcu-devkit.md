# NodeMCU DevKit

The Development Kit is an open-source firmware and development platform that helps prototype your IOT product within a few lines of Lua script[^1]. Based on the ESP8266, it integrates GPIO, PWM, I<sup>2</sup>C, 1-Wire and ADC all in one board.

Even though there are a few different ways to program the NodeMCU, we will be using the Arduino Software[^2]. This IDE is simple to use and makes "flashing" the DevKit easy.
