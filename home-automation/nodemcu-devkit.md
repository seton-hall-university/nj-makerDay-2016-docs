# NodeMCU DevKit

The Development Kit is an open-source firmware and development platform that helps prototype your IOT product within a few lines of Lua script[^1]. Based on the ESP8266, it integrates GPIO, PWM, IIC, 1-Wire and ADC all in one board. 

Even though there are a few different ways to program the NodeMCU, we will be using the Arduino Software[^2]. This IDE is very easy to use and makes "flashing"
