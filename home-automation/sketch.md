# The "Sketch"

Programs written using Arduino Software (IDE) are called sketches. These sketches are written in the text editor and are saved with the file extension .ino[^1]. Our sketch uses a couple of .ino files as a package instead of using one long file. The most recent code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/shuWebDev/nj-makerDay-2016). 

From the project page, [download the ZIP](https://github.com/shuWebDev/nj-makerDay-2016/archive/master.zip) file by clicking the button on the right hand side. Unzip the file and open "_reading_sensors.ino_" in the [Arduino Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). This should open all of the files in the project.

As you can see, there are a few tabs that have opened with the project. Each one of the tabs contain a small portion of the entire program. The first tab is the main program and "sets up" everything up.
