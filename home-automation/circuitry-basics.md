# Circuitry Basics

Learning the basics of electronics isn't that difficult. This should be a quick overview into practical electronics. It is not my goal to delve deeply into the science of electrical engineering. If you want to know more about the science of basic electronics, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics) is a good place to start your search.

## Electricity

There are two types of electrical signals, alternating current (AC), and direct current (DC).

With alternating current, the direction electricity flows throughout the circuit is constantly reversing. You may even say that it is alternating direction. The rate of reversal is measured in Hertz, which is the number of reversals per second. When they say that the US power supply is 60 Hz, what they mean is that it is reversing 120 times per second (twice per cycle).

With Direct Current, electricity flows in one direction between power and ground. In this arrangement there is always a positive source of voltage and ground (0V) source of voltage. You can test this by reading a battery with a multimeter. For great instructions on how to do this, check out [Ladyada's multimeter](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/multimeter) page. You will want to measure [voltage](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/multimeter/voltage.html) in particular.

Electricity is typically defined as having a voltage and a current rating. Voltage is rated in Volts and current is rated in Amps. For instance, a brand new 9V battery would have a voltage of "9" and a current of around 500mA (500 milliamps).

To get a better understanding of these different measurements, check out this video on Ohm's Law. It will show you what the measurements mean and how they relate to each other.
