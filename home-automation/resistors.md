# Resistors[^1]

As the name implies, resistors add resistance to the circuit and reduces the flow of electrical current. In a circuit diagram they are represented as a pointy squiggle with a value next to it.

The different markings on the resistor represent the value of resistance provided.

Resistors also come with different wattage ratings. For most low-voltage DC circuits, 1/4 watt resistors should be suitable.

You read the values from left to right towards the (typically) gold band. The first two colors represent the resistor value. The third represents the multiplier. And the fourth (the gold band) represents the tolerance or precision of the component. You can tell the value of each color by looking at a resistor color value chart.

Or... to make your life easier, you could look up the values using a graphical resistance calculator.

For example, a resistor with the markings brown, black, orange, gold will translate as follows:

1 (brown) 0 (black) x 1,000 = 10,000 with a tolerance of +/- 5%

Any resistor of over 1000 ohms is typically shorted using the letter K; e.g.:
 - 1,000 ohms = 1K
 - 3,900 ohms = 3.9K
 - 470,000 ohms = 470K.

Values of ohms over a million are represented using the letter M. In this case, 1,000,000 ohms would become 1M.
