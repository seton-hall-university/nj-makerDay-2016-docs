# Adafruit HDC1008 Temperature & Humidity Sensor

This I2C digital humidity sensor is a fairly accurate and intelligent alternative to the much simpler Humidity and Temperature Sensor - SHT15 Breakout It has a typical accuracy of ±4% with an operating range that's optimized from 10% to 80% RH. Operation outside this range is still possible - just the accuracy might drop a bit. The temperature output has a typical accuracy of ±0.2°C from -20~85°C.

The HDC1008 sensor chip has 2 address-select pins, so you can have up to 4 shared on a single I2C bus. It's also 3-5V power and logic safe so you don't need any level shifters or regulators to use with a 5V or 3V microcontroller.

Such a lovely chip, but only available in a tiny BGA package. So we spun up a breakout board with the chip and some extra passive components to make it easy to use. Each order comes with one fully assembled and tested PCB breakout and a small piece of header. You'll need to solder the header onto the PCB but it's fairly easy and takes only a few minutes even for a beginner.
