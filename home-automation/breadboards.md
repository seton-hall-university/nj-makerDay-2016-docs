# Breadboards[^1]

A switch is basically a mechanical device that creates a break in a circuit. When you activate the switch it opens or closes the circuit depending on the type of switch being used.

_Normally Open (N.O.)_ switches close the circuit when activated.

_Normally Closed (N.C.)_ switches open the circuit when activated.

As switches get more complex they can both open one connection and close another when activated. This type of switch is a single-pole double-throw switch (SPDT).

If you were to combine two _"SPDT"_ switches into one single switch, it would be called a double-pole double-throw switch (DPDT). This would break two separate circuits and open two other circuits, every time the switch is activated.
