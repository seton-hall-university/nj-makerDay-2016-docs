# Breadboards[^1]

Breadboards are special boards used to prototyping electronics. They are covered with a grid of holes, which are split into electrically continuous rows. By using a breadboard, you can build a circuit without soldering or twisting wires together. Connect the parts that should be wired together into one of the electrically continuous rows.

In the central part there are two columns of rows that are side-by-side. This allows you to be able to insert an integrated circuit into the center. Once inserted, each pin of the integrated circuit will have a row of holes connected to it.

Typically on each edge of the breadboard are two continuous bus lines. One is intended to be used for power and the other as a ground. By plugging power and ground respectively into each of these, you can access them from anywhere on the breadboard.
