# "Hello Maker World": An Intro to Web Development with Home Automation

### Ever wondered what makes web pages work? Thought about home automation and the Internet of Things? 

This workshop will introduce you to the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the basic tools required to create and style modern web pages. Creation of a header with navigation, use of images, use of contact forms, and social media links will be discussed. Popular coding tools will be used to explore the creation of simple web pages.

Once the basics of your website are set, we'll switch gears and learn how to wire up an Arduino. We'll attach a temperature and humidity sensor to get accurate readings of your surroundings. Through this process we'll discuss other possible sensors and how you can add them to your project.  When everything is up and running we'll learn how to send the data to a web server so you can check it from anywhere. In fact, we'll use the skills picked up in the first half of this workshop to add functionality to your website. We'll have it read the data coming from your project and display it on your site.

The aim of this project is to introduce new makers and tinkerers to the basics of web development with live data, circuitry, prototyping, and the Internet of Things. We will discuss the components used in the project. , how to "hook them up" properly and how to program the ESP8266-12e with a computer. 

Everything needed for this project will be provided. However, the only takeaways will be the code you write, the knowledge you've gained during the activity and the friends you've made along the way.
